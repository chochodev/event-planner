# EVENT PLANNER

# PAGES
- [home](#home)
- [Dashboard](#dashboard)
- [SignUp](#signup)
- [SignIn](#signin)

## HOME
This will serve as both the landing page and show some events available.

## EVENTS
This will display all available events.

## DASHBOARD
This will be the settings where:
- Create event button will be.
- My events (events created by this user) will be.
- - This will later lead to edit event page on click of an event.
- Edit account details (change name, and other credentials).

### DASHBOARD ACTIONS
- [Create Event](#create-event)
- [Event List](#event-list)
- [Edit Event](#edit-event)

## SIGNUP
This should entail a straight forward signup experience.

## SIGNIN 
This would be a cliche signing in method.
