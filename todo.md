# Project TO-DOs

This document outlines the tasks and enhancements planned for this project.

## Fixes Needed
1. **Undo and redo issue**: The undo and redo is behaiving weird.

## Features to Add
1. (In progress) **Seating Arrangement GUI**: Implement a drag-and-drop seating arrangement interface with functionalities similar to [Pretix Seat Prefix](https://seats.pretix.eu/).

2. What a muppet I've been:
- npm package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@seatsio/seatsio-react
- demo: https://docs.seats.io/docs/event-manager/modes/manage-object-statuses
